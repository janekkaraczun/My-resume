            <p>During studying at University I acquired numerous statistics skills, 
              including predicting economic processes and I learned basics of programming in R. 
              Afterwards I expanded my analytical skills while working in SEO and learned programming with the use of JavaScript, 
              CSS, HTML5 and React.js by myself.  I'm looking for a long term full-time job position in a stable and prosperous company 
              that will allow me to further develop my skills and provide me with knowledge and experience, which will allow me to meet the 
              need for continuous personal development. For CV in English or Polish email me to janek.karaczun@yahoo.com
              
              In my free time I'm passionate about science, music, sailing, enviorment protection and meditation. 
              Recently I enjoy gardening and investing in the financial market.</p>
