            <p>In 2018 I finished my education at Warsaw School of Life Sciences. During my studying I worked for several Companies including
            a startup called <a href="https://fakturomania.pl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fakturomania</a> in customer service and
            as a SEO & online marketing specialist. I have been learning programming in my free time for 2 years and I created this page
            as a presentation of what I have learned. Currently I'm looking for a job as a Front-End Web Developer or a job as a SEO & digital marketing specialist. I am open for job offers from all over the world as well as remote job offers.</p>
